# AlgoWiz

Welcome to AlgoWiz, where the fascinating world of algorithms comes to life through captivating visualizations! Algorithms are the backbone of modern computing, 
influencing everything from search engines to social media feeds, and now you have the opportunity to witness their inner workings in an engaging and interactive way.
Our algorithm visualizer is designed to demystify complex algorithms by providing a visually stunning and intuitive platform for users of all levels of expertise.
Whether you're a seasoned programmer looking to deepen your understanding or a curious learner eager to explore the magic behind computer science,
our platform offers a dynamic and educational experience.Immerse yourself in the visual representation of sorting algorithms
as they unfold before your eyes. Watch as algorithms dance through data, making decisions and optimizing processes in real-time. 
With our user-friendly interface, you can control the speed, pause, and step through each algorithm,
gaining insights into their inner workings at your own pace.

# Objectives
* User-Friendly Learning:Create a user-friendly interface that caters to both beginners and experienced programmers.Develop intuitive controls allowing users to adjust the speed, pause, and step through algorithms,
  ensuring a personalized and comfortable learning experience.
* Innovation and Exploration:Encourage users to explore the algorithms dynamically, enabling them to witness real-time decision-making and optimization processes.
  Foster a spirit of curiosity and innovation by providing a platform that sparks interest and encourages experimentation with algorithms.
* Accessibility and Inclusivity:Ensure accessibility for a diverse audience by optimizing the website for various devices and user needs.Provide content in multiple formats and languages
  to make algorithm education accessible to a global audience.

# Technology 
* The technology is uesd react js with vite and material ui this becuase of use of vite make the webiste more faster and react js helps to create dynamic design
  You can isntall vite + reactjs on the vite website there are the **npm commands** how the folders will created and how you cam set it up.

# Thoughts 
* This Algorithm visualizer have a user friendly interface and it is made on the sorting algorithm.
  This conatins all the sorting algorithm which are common in use.
  This also have a **ALL** button in navbar which have all the sorting together and it help to identify the whihc algorithm how how much does it take.
  There is also a speed up button which speeds the process of sorting.It also have generate button which will randomnly generate a sequence of number.
  It also swaps count which helps to keep track of how mnay time swapping is done.
